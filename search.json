    "text": "Hi! Welcome. We’re so glad you’re here.\nAt Your Neighborhood Scientist, we believe that science advocacy starts with you in your community. YNS is an initiative to cultivate community-based conversations around science, science policy, and scientists. In our newsletter, you’ll hear from scientists and community leaders about exciting, taxpayer-funded research that’s happening in the US. You’ll meet the incredible humans doing this work, and you’ll hear why they love what they do and the positive impact they have on the world around them.\nWhat’s your job? To share the joy.\nCurrently, there is an information gap between public perception of science and the reality of the good science does in our communities. Help us shift the narrative by talking to your neighbors, coworkers, family, and friends about why science is important in your community and why we need science policy that supports scientists doing the work they do best.\nThanks for supporting us, and cheers – to science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nConsider adding your@neighborhoodscientist.org to your contacts list to prevent our emails from going to spam"

    "text": "Your Neighborhood Scientist is an initiative to cultivate community-based conversations about science, science policy, and scientists.\nCurrently, there is an information gap between public perception of science and the reality of the good that science does in our communities. To help fill this gap, we publish a newsletter written by scientists and community leaders about exciting, taxpayer-funded research that’s happening in the US and the positive impact that science and science policy has on the world around us. We also talk about the diversity of people who do science, and the many ways that science helps our communities, often behind the scenes. Our articles are written and edited by the scientists doing the work, so you know that you’re getting information about what’s really happening - not just clickbait.\nOur hope is that our readers will help us shift the current national narrative by talking to their neighbors, coworkers, family, and friends about why science is important in their communities and why we need science policy that supports scientists doing the work they do best.\nWith your help, we can show the world that science benefits everyone and that our communities are better off for it.\n\nAre you interested in contributing an article?
