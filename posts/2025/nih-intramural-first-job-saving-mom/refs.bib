  abstract = {Background Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with a median overall survival of less than 2 years. In this study, we hypothesised that low-grade lymphomatoid granulomatosis is immune-dependent and high-grade lymphomatoid granulomatosis is immuneindependent. On the basis of this hypothesis, we investigated the activity and safety of new treatment with immunotherapy in patients with low-grade disease and standard chemotherapy in patients with high-grade disease.},
