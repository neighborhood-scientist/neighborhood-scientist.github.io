Hi! Welcome. We're so glad you're here.

At Your Neighborhood Scientist, we believe that science advocacy starts with you in your community.
YNS is an initiative to cultivate community-based conversations around science,
science policy, and scientists.
In our newsletter, you'll hear from scientists and community leaders about exciting,
taxpayer-funded research that's happening in the US.
You'll meet the incredible humans doing this work,
and you'll hear why they love what they do and
the positive impact they have on the world around them.

What's your job? To share the joy.

Currently, there is an information gap between public perception of science and
the reality of the good science does in our communities.
Help us shift the narrative by talking to your neighbors, coworkers, family,
and friends about why science is important in your community and why we need
science policy that supports scientists doing the work they do best.

Thanks for supporting us, and cheers â€“ to science.
